# Infinite Scrolling Photos with Unsplash API - React Source Code Submodule

This app is a personal project exploring infinite scrolling and APIs. It is a simple website where you enter a search term and related images are returned. More images load as you scroll.

You can check it out [here](https://www.sunkenworld.com/photo-search). 

This is just the submodule containing the front-end React 'src' source folder. To see the entire project, go to [this repository](https://github.com/mackenziewritescode/photo-search).
